# NOTE!

Jeg husker ikke hva som skjedde i hvilken film, men det er ikke så viktig så lenge det er ca. nøyaktig.

# Lore

Dongmaster was raised on a farm, eating the same 'steroid food' as the cows or something like that, hence why he is so strong.

# 1st Movie

Dongmaster is an upcoming hero on earth.

Women take over.

Ending of first movie is where Dongmaster kills an important politician with his boomerang penis.

Men will get "makrellisert"

# 2nd Movie

I guess this is where he gets roided.
(maybe a scientist in the military help him with this? *not official lore*)

He has to go undercover, finding out what is happening.

He walks around a dystopian city.

He meets up with a rich person who gives dongmaster a sexy suit.
This rich person gets to live in peace amongst the women because he is so wealthy/influential
That guy is jealous of Dongmaster and his massive muscles and big penis.

Women are looking for him.
Sexy Nun soldiers are on the lookout for him.
They have covered their faces because they had sexy bodies, but not sexy faces, and that was important for the women for some reason.

He kills them in a warehouse in batman style (swoope ned fra taket og ta ut en etter en)
He spares one, forcing her to reveal information.

# 4th Movie


# 5th Movie
