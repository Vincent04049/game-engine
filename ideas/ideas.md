# Ideas to implement

## Clean piss

The game starts by you having to clean piss because every kid has to do mandatory piss cleaning service.

After that the worlds open up for you completely.

## Work in Wacky Mac's chicken and burger shop

You are poor, so you have to take any job you can get. One is to brutally massacre tons of chickens in order to make the customers have a happy meal at Wacky Mac's.

## Travel and deliver cargo

Work as a transporter, delivering cargo from one end to the other end of the galaxy known to men.
Stay pure, or become a badboy who does not care about such thing as rules.

Pirates will try to take your cargo, be careful.

## Politician

Make your galaxy great again!

## Pirate

Steal cargo

## Travel to parallel Universes?

Maybe a cool idea?

## Bounty hunter

Work on finding various criminals and convicts.

### Bounty hunter: Chicken infiltration

You have to go undercover as a chicken in one of the chicken farms because someone (for example; dictator, corrupt politician) has been hiding there for 5 years.
Find out who is a real chicken, and who is the impostor among us

## Draft

Various ideas discussed:

- Pirate-inspired thoughts for the game.
- Consideration of halshugging (decapitation) in the medieval context.
- Introduction of the term "keelhaul" for a pirate-themed element.
- Discussion of spacevikings as a concept.
- Mention of "blood eagle," a brutal Viking ritual involving ribcage removal.
- Inclusion of the feudal political system in the game.
- Pyramid system explanation, involving kings, vassals, and their own subordinates.
- Addition of elements like caste system, racism, and segregation.
- Reference to India's historical caste system and feudal-like structure.
- Proposal to incorporate plundering and politics as central themes.
- Suggestion to include different races in the game.
- Proposal to create individual villages or planets as part of the game.
- Expansion of gameplay to include businesses, factories, and economic aspects.
- Idea to allow players to create their own bases or planets.
- Introduction of an editor and tools to involve friends in the game development process.
- Concept of floating bases in space, resembling the game "Rust."
- for eksempel om en karakter blir skadet og du har komt langt i spillet kan du lage forskjellige typer prostetics osv
- en annen ting eg tenkte litt på når det kommer til lore, i lethal company e det egt ikkje noe særlig lore som e viktig, men for de som e interessert kan man gå rundt på maps å lete etter "notater" fra en scientist eller scanne monstre så får man opp info om de skrevet av denne scientisten (unveil dongmaster)
