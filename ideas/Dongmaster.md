# NOTE!

Jeg husker ikke hva som skjedde i hvilken film, men det er ikke så viktig så lenge det er ca. nøyaktig.

# His gear

Over the course of his story, his gear gets regurlarly upgraded.

# Lore

Dongmaster was raised on a farm, eating the same 'steroid food' as the cows or something like that, hence why he is so strong.
the nuns killed his mother, because she wanted him to become the strongest soldier.

# 1st Movie

Dongmaster is an upcoming hero on earth.

Women take over. *(this can be changed to something else to make it less brutal for women)*  

Ending of first movie is where Dongmaster kills an important politician with his boomerang penis.

Men will get "makrellisert"

he lost his original penis.

at the end, someone picks it up

# 2nd Movie

he equips the real dong in the second movie.
there was a woman designing the dong tech, but she gets kidnapped.

I guess this is where he gets 'roided and better equiped with DongTech 1.0
(maybe a scientist in the military help him with this?)

He has to go undercover, finding out what is happening.

He walks around a dystopian city.

He meets up with a rich person who gives dongmaster a sexy suit.
This rich person gets to live in peace amongst the women because he is so wealthy/influential
That guy is jealous of Dongmaster and his massive muscles and big penis.

Women are looking for him.
Sexy Nun soldiers are on the lookout for him.
They cover their faces because they might have sexy bodies, but unfortunately lack good-looking faces and that was important for the women for some reason.

he killed them one by one because he didn't want to kill them actually.

He kills them in a warehouse in batman style (swoope ned fra taket og ta ut en etter en)
He spares one, forcing her to reveal information.

# 3rd Movie

I remember Dongmaster goes to space to visit the leader of the women.
he went to rescue, and ended up talking with leader, but it was a trap.
He gets taken as a prisoner, and i believe someone rescues him.
I think that's how they end up in the jungle.

in the jungle he choked people with his dong.


# 4th Movie

han gikk full assassin i jungel planeten.
han måtte overta en base.


# 5th Movie


# 6th Movie


# 7th Movie

I think i remember it being 7 movies (excluding prequesl movies)

## Post lore

**NB! This universe takes place in the DongMan / Schlongman / DongMaster / Schlongdongman / DongMaster universe, which is not a universe that is politically correct nor does it represent the opinions or values of the creators of this universe.**

This game takes place after the occurrences of the first 7 movies, meaning the world has already been taken over by women and most of the story of DongMaster has taken place. The whereabouts of DongMaster is currently unknown.

Elon Musk shot up rockets in secrecy, hoping to save as many of his fellow men.
Technology in space has evolved at a pace similar to the Personal computers once did back on earth.

Once you go to space there is no way of communicating with the world as MuskNet (Also known as StarLink) is the only available internet provider in space.
The state of Earth is none the less in a bad state, as by simply looking down on the blue planet you will see nuclear bombs are firing on a dailybasis.

Elon Musk knew about DongMaster, and helped him with his DongTech.
In return Elon got to place a Chip inside of DongMaster's head, in hopes that DongMaster Would be the first to survive the implant.

Elon might be the key to find DongMaster
