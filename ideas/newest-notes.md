Underground chicken cock fights 
Feed your own chicken and have him fight like Pokemon . 
There are AI pixel art of masculine's chickens fighting during the actual fights

Ships fly like birds to save energy 
You can see spaceship fly below you alone or in formation. 

Feed fishes and squirrels Birds flooding are sitting around in different places. 
Rain 
Leaves falling from trees

Not so tasks need to be done in The Orphanage to laundering of the floor and at night have a nice dialogue with your friends 
Eat food. 
Play various games, hide and seek. tikken, 
press space for å slenge seg

You get to the gas station you can buy food for your friends or buy something for yourself 

You are the son of dongmaster almost every kid in orphanage is the son of dog 

Philosophy: 
Some are just bystanders in life while others are destined for a task greater than life. 

10 years later and you work in a cargo transporting business your first solo mission lets you explore and experience factions borders inspections cities villages. 



When you visit a village in space a planet will be blurred in the background. 

- Homeless shelter 
- bordell 
- crack house 


You can hire a homeless people, or higher cheaper drones. Profit versus community. 

There are police officers around the villages 

Everything is quick and intuitive you're never stuck in a dialogue or loading screen

When you are left in space everything goes darker and the camera soon as slowly in 
To make fear

Wow 


When you set up a factory you can either buy instantly like in Sims 
Or you can fetch packages and set it up manually this will save money 


One mission where you have to go inside of a space cloud and turn off all lights 
The goal of that side Quest Can Be to infiltrate deliver cargo or hide 
A little bit like the Call of Duty 4 sniper mission where you have to move slowly because there are many enemies nearby 
- another idea: Shadow someone with a throne inside of a city

You become so successful that Elon Musk gets worried only if you take the dark path 




So people suicide 

Sign up for dating sites 
Get married 
farm crops (not profitable but honorable) 


Create your own entire faction 

Get that inside man or a correct policeman in your squad so you can deliver drugs safely 
Find and hire people for your business 
You can hire elderly people that live in elderly homes 


_____________________ COOL IDEA  ________________-- 

The AI that delivers your lawnmower for piss cleaning 
Is an AI that wants to find purpose but she does not know what purpose is and how to find it
The Voice says he will help 

--------------- 
The piss level the AI waits for the boy to finish she offers to help she asks about life and wholesome stuff 
She is at the end of life and will be replaced by a newer model 
When the boy asks if she is just a car she pops out with her rectangle formmy

The AI is not focused on what gender it is so the player gets to choose its pronouns

When the boy is finished the he will radio the officer

It will be a fancy UI and everyone you talk to will have its own detailed picture. 



----------------

The AI is a chip that can be plugged into electronic devices. 

A simple rectangle thing that flies is her main form 
Your choices in the game will affect the AI's behavior. 

the children will call her "sophie" (note to me : use sophie music) 
Reveal to the Elder children at night

Flash Forward 12 years later you are now a full-time Transporter. 


_________________ _ 
When delivering cargo you might have to drive around factions to avoid legal issues 
 On some missions certain side quests might occur: 
Engine trouble 
Help stranded people 
    - drag them to the nearest gas station 
coworkers need help 
You get hijacked 
Cargo disconnects 
sexy woman who steals your truck 
you discover a drugs or weapons in your cargo
_________________ 

You can also take drugs like cocaine or coffee to stay awake while delivering cargo 
That means there is a time system in the game and you may be you have to go to sleep as well or something like that 

You can eject piss from your spaceship 

You have your own little apartment with your own PC 

___ maybe 
You can steal Rob kill or kidnap 
___ 

Cat girls are in space Elon musk's secret project 

Conspiracy theories and why everyone is in space 
Maybe the memories of the first generation was changed 

Epic intro 
- drone delivers piss cleaner 
- then it will come an epic intro before gameplay starts? 

Interaction system like The Last of Us to show the player what it can interact with 

Multiple choices dialogue system art  (for me) 
Hovering over an option you get more information about it

Nfts are actually valuable in space because there is a finite amount,
When you go to the gas station the man asks you if you want to redeem your piss tokens into nfts which you can then turn into currency. 

There are nfts around the world to be found . 
You can find physical ones or they can be hidden in a USB
And they might actually be valuable 
But they have to be put in a feasible collectors card before actually being valuable. 
The government keeps tracked in order to make sure that each nft is unique 

mayby_____
There is only one music artist in space because he owns the only computer that has music software 
______ 


There are a limited amount of humans making every human life extremely valuable 
There is a human counter somewhere that is updated when new info is discovered maybe someone dies or someone gets born. 
killing another human is the biggest crime 

This is the reason why the government spends a lot of money on orphanages. 

not sure about this part: ___________ 
Mafia smuggles people but why do they do that I don't really know 
some Women sell their babies to the government
____________________

Elon was motivated to get mankind to space because you wanted to experience a space civilization before his death 

plot twist Elon is already dead we have been talking with his AI consciousness the whole time 
Maybe some conspiracy theory can be true I am not sure yet maybe the first generation of humans that went to space that they are memories were altered 

Sometimes you can meet a prisoner doing community service. 

note to me:__________ 
During cut scenes and important events you can use cool pixel art pictures in a very artistic way to make it cool. 
In this sequences I mix of cutscenes pictures dialogue with options and maybe gameplay if it fits. 

One idea is that he has to go undercover and then it will be a Western movie cowboy intro with the sun in the background and it's fades into his face and then it fits into something else while he is writing across the screen 
Maybe because Elon Musk sensing out on a mission and has to stay away from the government or not let the government know
