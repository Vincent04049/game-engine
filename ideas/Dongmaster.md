# NOTE!

Jeg husker ikke hva som skjedde i hvilken film, men det er ikke så viktig så lenge det er ca. nøyaktig.

# His gear

Over the course of his story, his gear gets regurlarly upgraded.

# Lore

Dongmaster was raised on a farm, eating the same 'steroid food' as the cows or something like that, hence why he is so strong.

# 1st Movie

Dongmaster is an upcoming hero on earth.

Women take over. *(this can be changed to something else to make it less brutal for women)*  

Ending of first movie is where Dongmaster kills an important politician with his boomerang penis.

Men will get "makrellisert"

# 2nd Movie

I guess this is where he gets 'roided.
(maybe a scientist in the military help him with this? *not official lore, can't remember what happened*)

He has to go undercover, finding out what is happening.

He walks around a dystopian city.

He meets up with a rich person who gives dongmaster a sexy suit.
This rich person gets to live in peace amongst the women because he is so wealthy/influential
That guy is jealous of Dongmaster and his massive muscles and big penis.

Women are looking for him.
Sexy Nun soldiers are on the lookout for him.
They cover their faces because they might have sexy bodies, but unfortunately lack good-looking faces and that was important for the women for some reason.

He kills them in a warehouse in batman style (swoope ned fra taket og ta ut en etter en)
He spares one, forcing her to reveal information.

# 3rd Movie

I remember Dongmaster goes to space to visit the leader of the women.
He gets taken as a prisoner, and i believe someone rescues him.
I think that's how they end up in the jungle.


# 4th Movie


# 5th Movie


# 6th Movie


# 7th Movie

I think i remember it being 7 movies (excluding prequesl movies)
